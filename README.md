## Motivation

ImageModifier offers a streamlined and intuitive approach, making it highly accessible to a wide range of users unlike many complex image processing tools that can be overwhelming for beginners and cumbersome for quick tasks. This package caters to both novices seeking an easy entry point into image manipulation and experienced users looking for a tool to perform quick modifications without the overhead of more complex software. With core functionalities like rotating, slicing, adding frames, and selecting RGB channels, ImageModifier simplifies these common tasks, allowing users to achieve their goals with minimal coding effort.

## Functions

**rotate_90**: Rotate a 2D image represented as a list of lists by 90 degrees clockwise.

**add_frame**: Embellishes an image with a frame, specified by the image path. The `framewidth` adjusts the frame's width.

**slice_image**: Slices a 2D list representing an image into a specified number of horizontal and vertical slices.

**select_channel**: Displays an image with/without a specified RGB channel modification and saves the processed image.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install image_modifier
```
