# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As members of the DSCI 524 class within the Master of Data Science (MDS) program at the University of British Columbia, and under the guidance of Professor Tiffany Timbers, we are dedicated to creating an environment that is open, inclusive, and supportive. We pledge to ensure participation in our project and course activities is free from harassment for everyone, regardless of personal characteristics or background.

## Standards of Conduct

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Employing welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting different viewpoints and experiences, recognizing the value they bring to our learning
* Accepting constructive feedback graciously
* Focusing on what is beneficial for both individual and communal learning experiences
* Demonstrating empathy and understanding towards fellow classmates

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

As contributors to this course, we are all responsible for upholding these standards. In cases where conduct is not aligned with our code, appropriate actions will be taken. 

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or the MDS community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Should any member of our class feel they have been subjected to behavior contrary to this Code of Conduct, they are encouraged to report it to the course staff. All reports will be handled with discretion and seriousness, aiming for a resolution that respects the dignity of all parties involved.

Failure to adhere to this Code of Conduct may result in consequences as deemed appropriate by Professor Tiffany Timbers and course staff, in line with the policies of the University of British Columbia.
